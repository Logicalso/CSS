Logical.so CSS Framework
========================

This is the wonderful Logical.so CSS framework. It's used by default in all of the themes used by Logical.so and gives a good starting point for new website designs.

Key Features
------------
You get a fancy 12 column grid system, some pretty forms and buttons and some other random CSS rules that I decided are necessary.

Should I use it?
----------------
Maybe? I find it incredibly useful when designing new websites, but keep in mind any changes style related or otherwise pretty much come as and when I feel like it.

Usage
=====
You can find the SCSS source files in the SCSS directory - these will be very useful if you want / need to make changes to the framework.

Otherwise you'll likely want to just import logical.min.css or logical.css into your own stylesheet. Whilst you certainly *could* make a website using just the Logical.so CSS, I'd advise against it. I don't want to find this to become another Bootstrap.
