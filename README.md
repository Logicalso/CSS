Logical.so CSS Framework
========================

This is the wonderful Logical.so CSS framework. It's used by default in all of the themes used by Logical.so and gives a good starting point for new website designs.

Key Features
------------
You get a fancy 12 column grid system, some pretty forms and buttons and some other random CSS rules that I decided are necessary.

Should I use it?
----------------
Maybe? I find it incredibly useful when designing new websites, but keep in mind any changes style related or otherwise pretty much come as and when I feel like it.

Usage
=====
You can find the SCSS source files in the SCSS directory - these will be very useful if you want / need to make changes to the framework.

Otherwise you'll likely want to just import logical.min.css or logical.css into your own stylesheet.

Whilst you can certainly get a decent enough looking website just from the Logical.so base styles, you probably won't get anything too spectacular either. This is intended to speed up development and give you something to build upon - not replace a site's CSS entirely.
