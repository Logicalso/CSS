Logical.so CSS Framework
========================

This is the wonderful Logical.so CSS framework. It is incredibly basic currently but you may find it useful for your own SCSS / CSS projects. It's pretty straightforward what it all does so you should find it fairly easy to tweak.

Usage
-----
Essentially just import logical.scss into your stylesheet. If you want to customise it start with defaults.scss - it should be fairly straightforward (although I promise to improve it soon).
